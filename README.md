# snow_modified
This branch is messed up... go to master, which is the updated version with ref to Azmisov's implementation: https://github.com/Azmisov/snow
Unfortunately the old bug is unfixed even after the reference. Yes the program still crashes when the snowballs "scatters" :(
Just leave a note here maybe someday I'll fix it...
